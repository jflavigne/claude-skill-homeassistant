# Automation ID Migration Plan
#
# Use with:
#   python3 scripts/ha_migrate_automation_ids.py preview examples/migration.yaml
#   python3 scripts/ha_migrate_automation_ids.py execute examples/migration.yaml
#
# This file maps old automation IDs (typically timestamps) to new descriptive IDs.
#
# IMPORTANT: You must also update the `id:` field in your automation YAML files
# to match the new IDs before running the migration.
#
# The migration tool will:
# 1. Stop Home Assistant
# 2. Update unique_id values in the entity registry
# 3. Preserve all metadata (area, icon, labels)
# 4. Reboot Home Assistant
#
# Generate a migration plan from your current state:
#   python3 scripts/ha_migrate_automation_ids.py generate > my_migration.yaml

migrations:
  # Format: 'old_id': new_id
  # or detailed format with comments

  # Climate automations
  '1734583537473':
    new_id: climate_kitchen_thermostat_schedule
    # entity_id: automation.kitchen_thermostat_schedule
    # has_metadata: true (will be preserved)

  '1734630745872':
    new_id: climate_elie_thermostat_schedule
    # entity_id: automation.elie_thermostat_schedule

  '1734929071522':
    new_id: climate_office_thermostat_schedule
    # entity_id: automation.office_thermostat_schedule

  # Simple format also works:
  # '1735000000000': climate_living_room_dynamic_thermostat

# After migration, your automations will have clean entity_ids
# without the _2 suffix, and all metadata will be preserved.
